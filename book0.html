<h2> Endorsements</h2>

<ul>
<li>"An astonishing machine learning book: intuitive, full of examples,
fun to read but still comprehensive, strong and deep! A great starting
point for any university student -- and a must have for anybody in the
field."
 -- Prof. Jan Peters, Darmstadt University of Technology/ 
Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems

<p>
<li>
"Prof. Murphy excels at unravelling the complexities of machine
learning methods while motivating the reader with a stream of
illustrated examples and real world case studies. The accompanying
software package includes source code for many of the figures, making
it both easy and very tempting to dive in and explore these methods
for yourself. A must-buy for anyone interested in machine learning or
curious about how to extract useful knowledge from big data."
-- Dr John Winn, Microsoft Research.

<li>

"This book will be an essential reference for practitioners of modern
machine learning.  MLAPA covers the basic concepts needed to
understand the field as whole and the powerful modern methods that
build on those concepts.  In MLAPA, the language of probability and
statistics reveals important connections between seemingly disparate
algorithms and strategies.  Thus its readers will become articulate
in a holistic view of the state-of-the-art and poised to build the
next generation of machine learning algorithms."
-- Prof. David Blei, Princeton University

<p>
<li>

"An amazingly comprehensive survey of the field, covering both the
basic theory as well as cutting edge research. Richly illustrated and
loaded with examples and exercises. I will tell my students (and
myself) to read this cover to cover!" 
-- Prof. Max Welling, U.C. Irvine

<p>
<li>

"This book covers an impressive range of the state-of-the-art in
statistical machine learning.  It defines a clear and broadly
accessible path that begins with the fundamentals of probability, and
leads to a rich toolbox of statistical models and learning
algorithms."
 -- Prof. Erik Sudderth, Brown University

<p>
<li>

"This book does a really nice job explaining the basic principles and
methods of machine learning from a Bayesian perspective.   It will
prove useful to statisticians interested in the current frontiers of
machine learning as well as machine learners seeking a probabilistic
foundation for their methods.  It hits the 4 c's:  clear, current,
concise, and comprehensive, and it deserves a place alongside 'All of
Statistics' and 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' on the practical
statistician's bookshelf."
 -- Dr Steven Scott, Google Inc

<p>
<li>

"This is a wonderful book
that starts with basic topics in statistical modeling, culminating in
the most advanced topics. It provides both the theoretical foundations
of probabilistic machine learning as well as practical tools, in the
form of Matlab code. The book should be on the shelf of any student
interested in the topic, and any practitioner working in the field."
-- Dr Yoram Singer, Google Inc

<p>
<li>
"I believe [this book]
 will become an essential reference for students and
researchers in probabilistic machine learning. It covers both
frequentist and Bayesian statistical viewpoints, which is helpful to
expose the similarities and differences between the two. It
has a thorough treatment of the basic material of supervised and
unsupervised learning, but goes beyond the basics to cover interesting
generalizations, e.g. section 17.6 on Generalizations of HMMs, and
recent work, e.g. on deep learning (chapter 28). There is also an
impressive suite of Matlab code to accompany the book, which will greatly
facilitate readers applying the models to their own
data, and building their own refinements."
--- Prof Chris Williams, Univ. Edinburgh

<p>
<li>
"This is an excellent textbook on machine learning, covering a number
of very important topics. The depth and breadth of coverage of
probabilistic approaches to machine learning is impressive. Having
Matlab code for all the figures is excellent. I highly recommend this
book!" -- Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani, U. Cambridge
