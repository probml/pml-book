      "Kevin Murphy’s book on machine learning is a superbly written,
      comprehensive treatment of the field, built on a foundation of probability theory.
      It is rigorous yet readily accessible, and
      is a must-have for anyone interested in gaining a deep understanding of machine learning."

	    "This book is a clear, concise, and rigorous introduction to the foundations of machine learning. 
	    It beautifully bridges between the "traditional" topics and the more "modern" deep learning methods, 
	    creating a unifying framework that contextualizes both of them. It's the book I recommend for people who are new to the 
	    field and want to obtain a comprehensive view of the core principles and methods."

		"This is a remarkable book covering the conceptual,
		theoretical and computational foundations of probabilistic machine learning, 
		starting with the basics and moving seamlessly to the leading edge of this field.  
		The pedagogical structure of the book is extremely useful for teaching. One of my favorite parts is
		that most of the figures  of the book have a link to the associated 
		(python, JAX, tensorflow) code that is used to generate them,
		often with comparisons between the different computational ways of solving the problems."

	  "This book could be titled 'What every ML PhD student should know'. 
	  If you master the material in this book, you will have an outstanding foundation for successful research in machine learning.”

    <p>
    <li> "There are many books on machine learning out there, but none gives
    such a well-rounded, up-to-date, and comprehensive view of the
    field as this one. We use this book as reference reading for our
    students taking the advanced machine learning course at Oxford to
    introduce them to fundamental as well as current topics in the
    field. I'm amazed at the amount of work that went into this
    book---which will surely be used by many to train the next
      generation of machine learning experts."

	      "This is a terrific resource for machine learning students and researchers.
		    If you want to understand the foundations of modern machine learning then this is the book to read. 
		    The text is particularly strong at marrying classical ideas from statistics and probability with more modern concepts such as deep learning."

		          <p>
  <li> "My favorite machine learning book just received a face-lift!
    'Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction' is the most
    comprehensive and accessible book on modern machine learning by a
    large margin.  
    It now also covers the latest developments in deep learning and
    causal discovery. With this upgrade it will remain the reference
    book for our field that every respected researcher needs to have
    on their desk."  -- <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/">Max Welling</a>,

	  "Prof Murphy's 2012 book was a triumph, covering both basic material
and also the state-of-the-art. The new 'Probabilistic Machine
Learning: An Introduction' is similarly excellent, and includes new
material, especially on deep learning and recent developments.  It
will become an essential reference for students and researchers in
	  probabilistic machine learning."
