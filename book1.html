      "Kevin Murphy’s book on machine learning is a superbly written,
      comprehensive treatment of the field, built on a foundation of probability theory.
      It is rigorous yet readily accessible, and
      is a must-have for anyone interested in gaining a deep understanding of machine learning."

		  <li>
	  "This book could be titled 'What every ML PhD student should know'. 
	  If you master the material in this book, you will have an outstanding foundation for successful research in machine learning.”
			  -- <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/">Tom Dietterich</a>, U. Oregon

    <p>
    <li> "There are many books on machine learning out there, but none gives
    such a well-rounded, up-to-date, and comprehensive view of the
    field as this one. We use this book as reference reading for our
    students taking the advanced machine learning course at Oxford to
    introduce them to fundamental as well as current topics in the
    field. I'm amazed at the amount of work that went into this
    book---which will surely be used by many to train the next
      generation of machine learning experts."
      -- <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/">Yarin    Gal</a>, U. Oxford

	    
	  <p>
	    <li>
	      "This is a terrific resource for machine learning students and researchers. If you want to understand the foundations of modern machine learning then this is the book to read. The text is particularly strong at marrying classical ideas from statistics and probability with more modern concepts such as deep learning."
	      -- <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/">Padhraic Smyth</a>, UC Irvine
		    
		          <p>
  <li> "My favorite machine learning book just received a face-lift!
    'Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction' is the most
    comprehensive and accessible book on modern machine learning by a
    large margin.  
    It now also covers the latest developments in deep learning and
    causal discovery. With this upgrade it will remain the reference
    book for our field that every respected researcher needs to have
    on their desk."  -- <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/">Max Welling</a>,
    U. Amsterdam 
	 
		    
      <p>
	<li>
	  "Prof Murphy's 2012 book was a triumph, covering both basic material
and also the state-of-the-art. The new 'Probabilistic Machine
Learning: An Introduction' is similarly excellent, and includes new
material, especially on deep learning and recent developments.  It
will become an essential reference for students and researchers in
	  probabilistic machine learning."
	  -- <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/">Chris Williams</a>, U. Edinburgh
