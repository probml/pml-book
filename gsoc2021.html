This page summarizes the contributions made to the
<a href="https://github.com/probml/pyprobml">pyprobml repo</a>
by some awesome members of the
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC</a>
and <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> communities
during the summer of 2021. The students were
mentored by
<a href="https://github.com/murphyk">Kevin Murphy</a>
and  <a href="https://github.com/mjsML">Mahmoud Soliman</a>.

<p>
	  	The  goal of the summer project was
	to create code to accompany my new textbook, <a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/">Probabilistic Machine Learning</a>.
	The first task was
	to finish translating <a href="https://github.com/probml/pmtk3">my old Matlab code</a> to Python, using modern libraries like 
	<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sklearn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a>.
	Fortunately, the students finished this translation task quicker than expected, so they had time to make lots of interesting new content.
	Below I give a little taste of some of these new examples. But first, let me introduce the students...

		<h1>Highlight reel</h1>
	
		Below I highlight one artefact per student, although they actually produced many more -- see their reports for details.
		
<h2><a id="hmm">HMMs for changepoint detection</h2>

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/probml-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/hmm_poisson_changepoint_jax.ipynb">hmm_poisson_changepoint_jax.ipynb</a>, by Aleyna.
<p>

  This uses an HMM with $K$ hidden states to segment a scalar time series
  into different "regimes".
  The observation (emission) model is Poisson.
  <br>
The <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Multiple_changepoint_detection_and_Bayesian_model_selection">original notebook</a> for this demo
was written using the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/TensorFlow_Distributions_Tutorial">Tensorflow probability distributions</a> library.
<br>
Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/main/tensorflow_probability/python/distributions/hidden_markov_model.py#L41-L1316">TFP source code for the HMM class</a>
is somewhat hard to read (mostly due to the need to handle batches), so we decided to write a 
<a href="https://github.com/deepmind/distrax/blob/master/distrax/_src/utils/hmm.py">
  pure JAX implementation  of HMMs</a>.
<br>
	This is much simpler, due to JAX primitives such as vmap.
Our code has since been upstreamed into <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/distrax">distrax library</a>
	from Deepmind. (Distrax is a JAX version of part of the TFP distributions library).

      <h2> ><a id="mixfa">Mixtures of (low-rank) Gaussians for CelebA faces</h2>

      <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/probml-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/mix_PPCA_celeba.ipynb">mix_PPCA_celeba.ipynb</a>, by Drishti.
<p>
  This colab uses  <a href="https://github.com/eitanrich/torch-mfa">this pytorch code</a> to demonstrate how to fit a mixture of low-rank Gaussians (i.e., probabilistic principal components model) to the CelebA face dataset.
  <br>
  After fitting, we can easily generate samples, and perform imputation
  from occluded images,   as shown below.

<h2> <a id="ekfmlp">EKF for online training of an MLP</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/scripts/ekf_mlp_anim_demo.py">
  ekf_mlp_anim_demo.py</a>
by Gerardo.

<p>
We fit a shallow MLP to a sequence of (x,y) pairs which arrive in a streaming fashion.
<br>
One epoch of Bayesian training trumps multiple epochs of SGD training!

  <h2> <a id="potts">Fast blocked Gibbs sampling for the Potts model using JAX</h2>

  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/probml-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/gibbs_demo_potts_jax.ipynb">gibbs_demo_potts_jax.ipynb</a>, by Ming.
      <p>
      
	Summary slide below. Note the phase transition at J=1.42, as predicted by theory.
	<br>
	This demo took 18 minutes with numpy+numba, but only 6s with JAX+math tricks :).

     <h2><a id="cliplogreg">Imagenette classifier using logistic regression + CLIP preprocessing</h2>

      <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/probml-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/clip_imagenette_demo.ipynb">clip_imagenette_demo.ipynb</a> by Srikar.

<p>
  <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenette">ImageNette</a>
  is a small version of Imagenet with just 10 classes,
  and ~10k training and ~4k test examples.
  <br>
  We used a pre-trained
  <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP">CLIP</a> model to perform feature extraction,
  and then fit a linear logistic regression model,
  using
  <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sklearn</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/google/flax">flax</a>,
  and <a href="https://pytorchlightning.ai/">pytorch lightning</a>.
  <br>
  Since the model has a convex loss,
  all methods get the same test set accuracy, namely 98.98%.
  Sample results below,
